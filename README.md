## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running Your Java Program  

### Example: `Main.java`

    }
}
```

## üì• Cloning and Pulling the Repository

Instead of downloading the repository directly, it is recommended to use **GitHub commands**.  
This way, you can easily pull any future updates without downloading the whole project again.

### üîπ Clone the Repository (one-time setup)
Open your terminal and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JurielUC/java-oop-examples.git
```
---
### üîπ Pulling the Latest Updates

If you have already cloned the repository before, you don‚Äôt need to clone it again.  
Instead, navigate to the project folder and pull the latest changes:

```bash
cd java-oop-examples
git pull
